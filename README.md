# Overview
Seam Carving is the most popular algorithm used to solve the problem of content aware image resizing which is proposed by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir. The main purpose of this Project is to study the seam carving algorithm and to implement it but not just to reproducing the same research paper written by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir but to implement the paper using our own method to seam carve using content aware image resizing.

This project takes into consideration the algorithm used for seam carving to find the image reduction, image enlargement, object removal by using the Energy Function used like Sobel (gradient magnitude) even though there are many other functions like entropy, visual saliency, eye gaze movement.
